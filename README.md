# SparkEvents

Original MVP prototype designed and built with Convergent @ UC Berkeley in the Spring semester of 2020.

------------

SparkEvents is a mobile app for UC Berkeley students to find, share, and explore local events on and off campus. The app serves as a one-stop mobile platform for event hosting, planning, and advertisement.

The prototype is currently being refined and built upon more as a personal side project.
